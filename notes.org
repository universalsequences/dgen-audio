* Target IR
** C
- each block goes into its own for loop inside the same process function
- thus, the TargetIR can output this so its really simple
- also lowering into one singular ~ScheduleItem~  + these for loops
- SIMD / Scalar can set the loops differently
- TargetIR can do things like "ADD_SIMD"
** Metal
- each block goes in its own kernel, thus they should all be in their own ~ScheduleItem~
